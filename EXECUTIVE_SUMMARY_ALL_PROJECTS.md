# ELECTRIC GLUE AI INITIATIVES
## Strategic Implementation Roadmap - Three Core Projects

**Prepared for:** Electric Glue Leadership Team  
**Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Prioritization & Budget Approval

---

## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Based on the AI Adoption Survey analysis of 10 team members, three strategic AI initiatives have been developed to address the primary barriers and opportunities identified:

1. **Quality concerns (60% of team)** → **Project 1: TrustCheck (Data QA Layer)**
2. **Analytics capabilities (50% of team)** → **Projects 1 & 2 (QA + Marketing Intelligence)**
3. **Time-consuming research (team-wide)** → **Projects 2 & 3 (Marketing Intelligence + Influencer Discovery)**

These projects are designed to:
- **Unlock broader AI adoption** by addressing quality concerns
- **Create new revenue streams** through productized AI services
- **Establish competitive differentiation** as an AI-first boutique agency
- **Build foundation for agentic workflows** that can scale across the business

---

## PROJECT PORTFOLIO SUMMARY

| Project | Timeline | Budget | Impact | Priority |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| **1. TrustCheck (QA Layer)** | 12 weeks | £15-25K | Unlock adoption for 60% of team | **HIGHEST** |
| **2. Scout (Marketing Intel)** | 16 weeks | £20-35K | 3-5x more pitch capacity | **HIGH** |
| **3. Matchmaker (Influencer)** | 14 weeks | £18-30K | 3-4x influencer campaign volume | **MEDIUM** |

**Total Investment:** £53-90K across all three projects  
**Payback Period:** 6-9 months (via time savings + new service revenue)  
**Expected ROI:** 300-500% in Year 1

## PROJECT 1: TRUSTCHECK - AI-POWERED DATA QA LAYER
*"Solving the #1 barrier to AI adoption"*

### The Problem
60% of the team cite quality concerns as their primary blocker to using AI more broadly, especially for high-stakes client deliverables. This prevents adoption for:
- Data-heavy client reports
- Campaign effectiveness analysis  
- Strategic recommendations
- Predictive modeling

### The Solution
An automated quality assurance system that:
- ✅ Validates AI-generated metrics against actual data sources (GA4, Meta Ads, etc.)
- ✅ Detects hallucinations and unsupported claims
- ✅ Flags statistical anomalies
- ✅ Provides confidence scoring (Green/Amber/Red)
- ✅ Cites sources for every validated claim

### Key Deliverables
- Streamlit dashboard for uploading/validating reports
- 4 validation modules (data cross-reference, hallucination detection, anomaly detection, source verification)
- Integration with GA4, Supermetrics, Meta/Google Ads APIs
- Knowledge base of client benchmarks and industry standards
- Google Docs export with validation annotations

### Success Metrics (6 months)
- **Adoption:** 80% of client reports validated through system
- **Accuracy:** <5% false positive rate
- **Time Savings:** 100+ hours per month across team
- **Team Confidence:** Quality concerns drop from 60% → <25%

### Timeline & Investment
- **MVP:** 4 weeks (£5-8K)
- **Full Deployment:** 12 weeks (£15-25K total)
- **Ongoing Costs:** £300-500/month (APIs + hosting)

### Why This First?
This project **unblocks adoption** for the largest segment of the team. Until quality concerns are addressed, many team members won't expand AI use beyond low-stakes tasks. This is the gating factor.

---

## PROJECT 2: SCOUT - MARKETING INTELLIGENCE ASSISTANT
*"From 8 hours of research to 30 minutes"*

### The Problem
50% of team requests advanced analytics and insights capabilities. Currently, preparing for new business pitches or competitive analysis requires 4-8 hours of manual research per opportunity. This limits:
- Number of pitches team can pursue
- Depth of strategic thinking in pitches
- Competitive intelligence quality
- Speed to market for new opportunities

### The Solution
An agentic AI system with three specialist agents:
- **Company Research Agent:** Deep-dives into target company's business, marketing strategy, financials
- **Competitive Analysis Agent:** Maps competitive landscape, share of voice, positioning
- **Market Trends Agent:** Identifies emerging trends, consumer behavior shifts, industry dynamics

Orchestrated by a master agent that produces comprehensive research briefs in 20-30 minutes.

### Key Deliverables
- LangGraph-based multi-agent orchestration platform
- Integration with 10+ data sources (Crunchbase, SEMrush, Ahrefs, Google Trends, etc.)
- Streamlit dashboard + Slack bot interface
- PostgreSQL database of past research (searchable knowledge base)
- Google Docs auto-generation of formatted briefs

### Success Metrics (6 months)
- **Time Savings:** 150+ hours per month
- **Research Volume:** 30+ briefs per month
- **Quality:** 4.5/5+ team rating on usefulness
- **New Business Impact:** Contribute to 3+ pitch wins
- **Service Revenue:** Launch "Market Intelligence as a Service" offering

### Timeline & Investment
- **MVP (Single Agent):** 4 weeks (£6-9K)
- **Multi-Agent System:** 8 weeks (£10-15K)
- **Production Ready:** 12 weeks (£20-30K total)
- **Ongoing Costs:** £800-1500/month (APIs + hosting)

### Productization Opportunities
**New Services:**
1. **Pitch Prep Research:** £2-4K per brief (sell to other agencies or consultancies)
2. **Competitive Intelligence Retainer:** £3-6K/month (ongoing competitor monitoring for clients)
3. **Market Opportunity Assessments:** £5-8K (evaluate new market entry for clients)

---

## PROJECT 3: MATCHMAKER - INFLUENCER DISCOVERY & VETTING
*"AI-powered creator intelligence"*

### The Problem
Influencer research currently takes 8-15 hours per campaign:
- Manual platform searches (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
- Individual creator vetting (fake followers, brand safety, audience quality)
- Comparison and ranking
- Building campaign rosters

This limits campaign volume and slows time-to-launch.

### The Solution
Three-agent system that automates the entire workflow:
- **Discovery Agent:** Finds 100-200 relevant influencers across platforms based on campaign brief
- **Vetting Agent:** Analyzes authenticity, brand safety, audience demographics, engagement quality
- **Ranking Agent:** Scores and prioritizes by brand fit, reach, cost-effectiveness

Delivers campaign-ready rosters in <30 minutes.

### Key Deliverables
- Multi-platform discovery (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn)
- Integration with Hypeauditor (fake follower detection), SEMrush, Ahrefs
- PostgreSQL database of 10K+ influencer profiles (continuously updated)
- Streamlit dashboard + Slack bot
- Google Sheets export (formatted roster) + PDF influencer profiles

### Success Metrics (6 months)
- **Time Savings:** 100+ hours per month
- **Discovery Volume:** 500+ influencers analyzed per month
- **Campaign Performance:** +15% engagement rates (better creator-brand fit)
- **Campaign Volume:** 2x increase in influencer campaigns handled
- **Service Revenue:** £50K+ from "Influencer Audit" service

### Timeline & Investment
- **MVP (Instagram Only):** 4 weeks (£5-8K)
- **Multi-Platform:** 8 weeks (£8-12K)
- **Full Production:** 14 weeks (£18-30K total)
- **Ongoing Costs:** £650-1000/month (APIs + hosting)

### Productization Opportunities
**New Services:**
1. **Influencer Campaign Roster:** £2-4K (deliver vetted roster in 48 hours)
2. **Influencer Audit:** £500-1K per creator (detailed vetting report)
3. **Ongoing Influencer Intelligence Retainer:** £3-6K/month (monthly emerging creator reports)
